### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer and researcher (an alumnus of [HKU PL Group](https://hkuplg.github.io)). I'm interested in programming languages and distributed systems. I like functional programming and how its aspects make it into other languages. Rust is my goto language at the moment.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on maintaining the [pest parser generator for Rust](https://pest.rs).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ActivityPub.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on [pest3](https://github.com/pest-parser/pest/discussions/640#discussioncomment-5714118).
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with [issues on pest](https://github.com/pest-parser/pest/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahelp-wanted).
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Rust.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ping me on GitHub or LinkedIn
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm experimenting with [honk](https://humungus.tedunangst.com/r/honk), a minimalistic ActivityPub implementation. If you're on Mastodon (or elsewhere on the fediverse), you can follow or say hi to [@tom@tomtau.be](https://tomtau.be/u/tom).
